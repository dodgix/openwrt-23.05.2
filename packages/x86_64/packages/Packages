Description:  The Go programming language is an open source project to make
 programmers more productive.
 
 Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency
 mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of
 multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables
 flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to
 machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power
 of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language
 that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.
 
 This package provides the documentation for the Go programming language.

 code written in another language. The libffi library really only provides the
 lowest, machine dependent layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.
 A layer must exist above libffi that handles type conversions for values passed
 between the two languages.

Description:  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
 language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high
 level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming
 paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and
 functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear
 syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as
 to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also
 usable as an extension language for applications that need a
 programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many
 Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows.
 
 This package contains only core Python library.

Description:  NaCl (pronounced "salt") is a new easy-to-use high-speed software library for network communication, encryption, decryption, signatures, etc.
 NaCl's goal is to provide all of the core operations needed to build higher-level cryptographic tools.
 Sodium is a portable, cross-compilable, installable, packageable fork of NaCl (based on the latest released upstream version nacl-20110221), with a compatible API.
 The design choices, particularly in regard to the Curve25519 Diffie-Hellman function, emphasize security (whereas NIST curves emphasize "performance" at the cost of security), and "magic constants" in NaCl/Sodium have clear rationales.
 The same cannot be said of NIST curves, where the specific origins of certain constants are not described by the standards.
 And despite the emphasis on higher security, primitives are faster across-the-board than most implementations of the NIST standards.

Description:  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
 language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high
 level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming
 paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and
 functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear
 syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as
 to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also
 usable as an extension language for applications that need a
 programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many
 Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows.

Description:  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
 language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high
 level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming
 paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and
 functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear
 syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as
 to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also
 usable as an extension language for applications that need a
 programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many
 Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows.
 
 This package contains the uuid module.
